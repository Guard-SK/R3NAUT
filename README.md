## Hello!
Hi! My name is Guard, and this is my bot. I built it, because I wanted to learn python and the best (and fun) way that showed up to me was discord.py. 

### About the past of the bot
This bot is built by tutorial from Carbretta (link at the end of README), but edited to function on my server. I'm trying to get away from Carbretta's tutorials, so some of the features are different, but the base of the code is the same as Carbretta. Really recommend checking him out if you want to start with discorrd.py or learn more about discord moderation bot coding.

## What does he bring today?
So... there is a lot to talk about ngl. This project gotten pretty big and has some goooood features I'm proud of. So we shall start with:
